<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Onnet exists to make it easy to plot structural information
on stereonets.  The input files are designed to be easily read
and editted by a user.  This facilitates it's
use in two ways.  Field data can be plotted by making an onnet input
file with the editor or programs that compute information can write
onnet input files.  Onnet is then used to translate these English
language files into postscript which can be viewed either on screen
with a postscript viewer or printed on any postscript printer.
One of the nicest things about onnet is that you can edit a plot with it.
For instance you plot a bunch of field data, later you can add
interpretation symbols to the plot with little extra effort.  Also
the symbols used to plot data, or the way it is viewed can also
be changed with little effort.  As the output files are in postscript,
they can be read into Adobe Illustrator (or other drafting programs) for
further customizing.
<p>
Here's an example input file and the output:<br>
<pre>
# put on a title
title Example 1
#
# draw a plane with dip direction = 20 and E of N and dipping 30 degrees
plane 20 30
# draw the pole to the plane mentioned above
pole 20 30
#
# draw a small circle centered at an azimuth of 280 degrees, plunging 40 degrees
# and 20 degrees in diameter
small 280 40 20
</pre>
<img src="example1.gif">
<p>
You should also be aware of the <a href="#PROGRAMS">programs</a>
stnet and sttics that
draw a standard stereonet or tics on a stereonet for use with onnet.
<p>
Onnet was written by Andy Michael while at Stanford University and
was updated into the postscript writing version 2.0 at the USGS.
The algorithm for small circles cribbed from Paul Layer.
<p>
Onnet was written in such a way as
to make adding features easy.  So if it doesn't do something you
want, please tell me by sending mail to andy@andreas.wr.usgs.gov.  However,
remember that onnet is a plotting program.  It plots data or results;
it does not, and should not, perform manipulations on the data.  Thus
suggestions that onnet should compute rotations or contour data are
not likely to be acted upon.  However programs that do these could
very easily plot their output by writing onnet input files.
<p>
<a name="INSTALL">
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
Step 0: Obtain executable program from
<a href="http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/~michael/software">
http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/~michael/software</a> if one for your
system is available.  Otherwise go to step 1.
<p>
Step 1: Obtain the source code for onnet from
<a href="http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/~michael/software">
http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/~michael/software</a>.
After obtaining the file you will need to uncompress it and use the tar
command to extract the files.
<p>
Step 2: Onnet uses the GMT (Generic Mapping Tools) postscript subroutine
libraries (version 3.3 or later).  If GMT is installed on your machine
then edit the file Makeonnet to point to the location of the libraries
and include files.  If GMT is not installed on your machine then obtain
it from <a href="http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/gmt">http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/gmt</a>.
They have made the installation process very easy.
<p>
Step 3: Give the command "make -f Makeonnet".  This should compile the code
and produce the executable file onnet.  To make stnet and sttics give the
commands "make -f Makestnet" and "make -f Makesttics".
<p>
Step 4: Put onnet, stnet, and sttics in a directory in your search path
so that you can run them from anywhere.
<p>
Step 5: If you have created an executable for a system not available on
the web site and are willing to let me put it there send me email at
<a href="michael@andreas.wr.usgs.gov">michael@andreas.wr.usgs.gov</a>.
<p>
<a name="USAGE">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
The simplest usage for onnet is to put the commands into an input file (let's
call it input) and create a file called output.ps with the command:
<br>
% onnet input > output.ps
<br>
output.ps can then be viewed with a postscript viewer such as ghostscript
or printed on any postscript plotter.
<p>
Input files can also be specified as "onnet in=input" or just by listing
them on the command line such as "onnet input".  Multiple input files can
be specified and will be processed to make one plot.  The order of processing
goes as follows:
<br>
onnet in=input2 input3 input4 < input1 > output.ps
<br>
where the files are processed in the order input1, input2, input3, and input4.
<p>
Output files are either on standard out as shown above or can be specfied
as "onnet out=output.ps".  Errors will go to standard error and can also
be placed in a files specified as "onnet err=errorfile" and all error messages
will be in a file called errorfile.
<p>
<a name="INPUT">
<h2>Input Files</h2>
<p>
This section is the meat of the documentation, it tells you everything
onnet can do, and how to structure an input file.  Input lines in
onnet files are divided into viewing parameters and commands and
comment lines.  Viewing parameters control how things will be displayed
such as the thickness of lines or the color of symbols.  Commands actually
plot things like planes, poles, or lines.
<p>
The input lines can come in any order except:
<ul>
<li>
viewing parameters only affect commands that come after them so you need
to set them before they are to take affect.
<li>
the outer circle of the stereonet is
drawn before the first other object is plotted.  So the viewing
parameters for the circle must be given before the first command except
the title which is plotted last no matter when it is given.
<li>
if two commands plot in the same
spot on the stereonet the later one will be on top of the earlier one.
</ul>
Please note the following common elements in onnet input lines so that they
do not need to be repeated for each command or viewing parameter.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Input lines are in free format.  Values should be separated by white space
(e.g. blanks or tabs) and numeric values can be given as either integers
or floating point numbers.
<li>
Most commands and viewing parameters have long and short names.  They
can be used interchangably.
<li>
Many of the viewing parameters can set things so they plot differently on
the lower and upper hemispheres.  For instance the input line "color line blue
red" will plot all lines on the lower hemisphere in blue and those on the
upper hemisphere in red.  However, to set it so things plot identically on
both hemispheres you can leave out the upper hemisphere value such as
"color line blue" which makes all lines on both hemispheres blue.  This
is equivalent to "color line blue blue".  The optional upper hemisphere
values are in square brackets to remind you that they are optional.
Note that that some things such as planes and poles always plot on the lower
hemisphere and thus setting the upper hemisphere is meaningless.
<li>
Many of the viewing parameters take a "choice" which states which objects
the viewing parameter is being set for.  For instance in "color line blue"
the choice is line.  Possible choices are any of the commands
(e.g. line, plane, pole, rake, small, great, draw) circle and all.
The choice circle sets this parameter for the outer circle of the stereonet.
As noted above the vieweing parameters for the circle must be given before
the first command other than the title.
The choice all sets this
parameter for all of the possible choices.  Note that some combinations
don't make sense such as setting the font of planes which are not text
elements or setting any viewing parameter for move (which just moves the
pen).  Onnet will issue warnings about some of this nonsensical combinations
but sometimes it just lets them go without complaining.
<li>
I have attempted to keep onnet backwards compatible to earlier versions.
Exceptions include changing the stereonet radius default to 8 cm and the
pointsize default for text to 12 points for most commands and 16 for the title.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Viewing Parameters</h3>
<p>
<dl>
<dt>angle choice lower [upper]
<dd>
angle sets the angle text will be plotted at for the text plotting choices
such as line, pole, rake, text, and title.  Lower and upper are numbers from 0
to 360 and the defaults are 0.  Angles are measured counter-clockwise from
horizontal.  The short name is a.

<dt>color choice lower [upper]
<dd>
color changes the color that the lines or symbols for the command
choice to lower and/or upper.  Lower and upper
can be either an integer from 0 to 7 or one of the corresponding following color
names:  black 0, blue 1, red 2, purple 3, green 4, skyblue 5, yellow 6,
and white 7.  Or lower and upper can be replaced with three numbers from 0
to 255 that will be used as rgb values.  For example: "color line 1"
will make all later lines blue it is equivalent to "color line blue"
and "color line 0 0 255".  However, do not mix types of color specifications on
the same line.  In other words, "color line blue red" will work but I'm
not promising that "color line blue 2" will do the same thing.
The default is black.
The short name is c.

<dt>fat lower [upper]
<dd>
This exists for backwards compatibility and new files should use the
width command.   It is the equivalent of "fatness all lower [upper]".
The units are as explained for the fatness viewing parameter below.


<dt>fatness choice lower [upper]
<dd>
fatness exists for backwards compatibility, the preferred command is width.
fatness changes the thickness of the lines or symbols for the command
choice to the values given for lower and/or upper.  The units are in the
archaic 1/33 of an inch from the outdated Stanford Geophysics vplot plotting
system.  The default is 0.25 units (or 0.5 points).
fatness no longer affects the appearance of text when plotted with the
line, pole, title,
To affect how these commands appear try the font
command where you can select regular or bold fonts.
text or rake commands because these now use real fonts and not attempts to
draw letters with vectors.
However, when a geometric symbol is
used (see the symbol viewing parameter).  Then the width affects the black
line that outlines the character.
The short name is f.

<dt>focal
<dd>
causes all plunges after the commands
to be interpreted as take-off angles which
are 0 at vertical down, 90 at horizontal, and 180 at vertical up.
This affects the line, text, small, move, draw, and great commands.
This can be handy for plotting earthquake first motions.
The default is notfocal.

<dt>font choice lower [upper]
<dd>
font changes the font for the text choices such as line, pole, rake, text,
and title.  Lower and upper are integers corresponding to the GMT fonts.
The fonts available are:  0 = Helvetica,
1 = H. Bold, 2 = H. Oblique, 3 = H. Bold-Oblique, 4 = Times, 5 =
T. Bold, 6 = T. Italic, 7 = T. Bold Italic, 8 = Courier, 9 = C. Bold,
10 = C Oblique, 11 = C Bold Oblique, 12 = Symbol, 13 = AvantGarde-Book,
14 = A.-BookOblique, 15 = A.-Demi, 16 = A.-DemiOblique, 17 = Bookman-Demi,
18 = B.-DemiItalic, 19 = B.-Light, 20 = B.-LightItalic, 21 = Helvetica-Narrow,
22 = H-N-Bold, 23 = H-N-Oblique, 24 = H-N-BoldOblique, 25 =
NewCenturySchlbk-Roman,
26 = N.-Italic, 27 = N.-Bold, 28 = N.-BoldItalic,
29 = Palatino-Roman, 30 = P.-Italic, 31 = P.-Bold, 32 = P.-BoldItalic,
33 = ZapfChancery-MediumItalic.  If lower or upper are outside this range, it is set
to 0.
The default is 8 or Courier.
The short name is fo.

<dt>pointsize choice lower [upper]
<dd>
pointsize sets the point size of the text plotted with the choices such
as line, pole, rake, text, and title.  Lower and upper are numbers and
the units are points (1/72 of an inch).  Defaults are 12 points and 16 for the
title.  The short name is ps.

<dt>gray choice lower [upper]
<dd>
gray acts exactly like color except that the lower and upper values are
integers from 0 to 255 and this integer will be used for all three of
the rgb values.  For instance,
"gray line 200 100" is the same as "color line 200 200 200 100 100 100".
This just makes it easier to set grayscale values.
The default is black.
The short name is gr.

<dt>notfocal
<dd>
causes all plunges after the command to be interpreted as plunges.
This is the default.  notfocal will rarely be called, and usually
only if focal was called earlier in the file.

<dt>radius x
<dd>
radius changes the radius of the plot to x centimeters.  This is the
most constrained command because it must come before any commands
that actually draw things (e.g. plane, pole, rake, line, small, move, draw,
great).  You should give it at the top of the file.  The default is
8 cm.  The short form of the command is r.


<dt>reflect
<dd>
causes all information on the upper hemisphere to be
reflected about the center of the sphere and plotted on the lower
hemisphere.  This is the default, if neither reflect or through are
specified reflect will be used.  Although upper hemisphere information
is reflected onto the lower hemisphere to locate it, the viewing parameters
for the upper hemishpere are used.  For instance, you can use different
colors or fonts for the two hemispheres.

<dt>schmidt
<dd>
causes the Schmidt equal-area projection to be used for all items
after it is called.  It is the default and will be used if neither
schmidt or wulff are called.

<dt>size choice lower [upper]
<dd>
size is included for backward compatibility.  The prefered command
is pointsize.
size changes the size of the symbols for the command
choice.  Lower and upper are numbers and the units are 1/33 of an
inch from the outdated Stanford vplot plotting programs.
The default size is 6 except for the title which is 7.
Note the default for title is 10  The short name is sz.

<dt>
symbol choice lower [upper]
<dd>
symbol changes the symbols used to plot the command choice.
The values for lower and upper can be any single ascii character
in which case that character is used or they can be one of the following
words in order to plot a geometric symbol.  The geometric symbols
are plotted in the current color for the choice and outlined in black
with the current pen width for the choice.  Possible
geometric symbols are circle, cross (not outlined in black), diamond, hexagon,
itriangle (an inverted triangle), square, star (a five pointed star), and
triangle.  The circles have a diameter equal to the current point size for
the choice and all other geometric symbols are inscribed into this size
circle (don't ask why, that's how the GMT subroutine library does it).
An attempt has been made to get the ascii characters to center properly and
it works well for the default font (courier).  If you need very accurately
centered symbols test them by plotting a cross and the symbol at the same spot.
Defaults are pole 'o' (all on lower hemisphere), line 'x' and 's', and rake '+' and '*'. 
The short name is sy.

<dt>through
<dd>
causes all information on the upper hemisphere to be plotted
as if you were above the sphere and were looking down onto the lower
hemisphere.  The viewing type may be changed at ANY line at the file
after the title, although it is rare you will want to, so it will
probably be given once (if it all) near the top.

<dt>width choice lower [upper]
<dd>
width changes the thickness of the lines or symbols for the command
choice to the values given for lower and/or upper.  The units are in points and
the default is 0.5 points.
width no longer affects the appearance of text when plotted with the
line, pole, title,
To affect how these commands appear try the font
command where you can select regular or bold fonts.
text or rake commands because these now use real fonts and not attempts to
draw letters with vectors.
However, when a geometric symbol is
used (see the symbol viewing parameter).  Then the width affects the black
line that outlines the character.
The short name is w.

<dt>wulff
<dd>
causes the Wulff equal-angle projection to be used for all items
after it is called.  The projection can be changed at any time,
but it is rare that you will want to, so either schmidt or wulff
should be specified once at the top, if at all.
The only time you might
want to change within a file is if you are trying to demonstrate
the effects of the two projections.

</dl>
<p>
<h3>Commands</h3>
<p>

<dt>draw trend plunge
<dd>
draw draws from the last point to trend plunge.  It can only be given
after move or draw.  move and draw are useful to draw shapes onnet
does not know about (yet?).  The short name is d.

<dt>line trend plg
<dd>
causes a character to be plotted to denote a line
(i.e a lineation, magnetic pole or an end of an axis) with direction trend
and plunge plg.  For lines on the lower hemisphere (positive plunges)
an "x" is plotted, on the upper hemisphere "s" is plotted.
The short name is l.

<dt>great trend1 plunge1 trend2 plunge2
<dd>
great draws a great circle segment connecting the point trend1 plung1
and trend2 plunge2.  It does not do well if reflect viewing is used
and the great circle segment crosses from the upper hemisphere to the
lower hemisphere.  The short name is g.

<dt>move trend plunge
<dd>
move moves the pen (without drawing)
to the point with direction trend and plunge plunge.  It is most likely
followed by one or more draw commands.
The short name is m.

<dl>
<dt>plane ddir dip
<dd>
causes a plane to be drawn on the plot with dip
direction ddir, and dip dip.  The short name is p.

<dt> pole ddir dip
<dd>
causes the pole to a plane with dip
direction ddir, and dip dip to be plotted.  Poles are all on the lower
hemisphere and are denoted with an "o" by default.  The short name is po.

<dt>rake slip_angle
<dd>
rake causes a character to be plotted denoting the slip vector on a
fault.  Rake must come directly after either plane or pole, because
the slip vector is constrained to be in the plane.  rake can also
follow itself to allow plotting multiple slip vectors on one plane,
or w.r.t. one pole.  Rakes on the upper hemisphere
(thrusts) are plotted by "*", and on the lower hemisphere (normal
faults) "+" is used.  The slip angle is measured within the plane, on
the foot wall, from horizontal such that 0 degrees represents a left
handed strike slip fault.  90 is a pure thrust, 180 a right handed
strike slip, and 270 a pure normal fault.  These represent the 
standard seismology conventions.
The short name is rk.

<dt> small trend plg dist
<dd>
causes a small circle to be drawn with it's
center at the point trend, plg with radius given in degrees by dist.
The short name is s.

<dt>text trend plunge :string
<dd>
text posts the string of text at the point trend plunge.  The first
character of the string will be positioned so that if it is a capital
letter it will be centered on the given point.  The string starts
immediately after the colon and can include spaces (and even start
with a colon). The short name is t.

<dt>title rest of line
<dd>
Sets the title of the plot to be whatever is the rest of the line.
The title is plotted last so it can be specified anywhere within
the file, but only once.  For backwards compatibility if onnet
does not understand the first line of the file it becomes the title.
</dl>

<h3>Miscellaneous lines</h3>
<p>

<dl>
<dt># Rest of line.
<dd>
Any line beginning with a '#' is a comment line.
<dt>version
<dd>
Causes onnet to put out a message about it's version number on
standard error or the error file if specified.
</dl>

<h3>Examples</h3>
