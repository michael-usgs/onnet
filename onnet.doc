A Users Manual for
ONNET
Stereonets Made Easy
.SH
Introduction
.PP
Onnet is an easy to use program that allows the plotting of various
structural information on stereonets.  It is designed so the input
files are easy to read and edit by the user.  This facilitates it's
use in two ways.  Field data can be plotted by making an onnet input
file with the editor, or programs that compute information can write
onnet input files.  Onnet is then used to translate these English
language files into a plot file that can then be displayed on the
screen or on the imagen or any other plotting device.  One of the
nicest things about onnet is that you can edit a plot with it.
For instance you plot a bunch of field data, later you can add
interpretation symbols to the plot with little extra effort.  Also
the symbols used to plot data, or the way it is viewed can also
be changed with little effort.  When a number is specified in an
onnet command or viewing parameter it may either be an integer
or a real number, and parts of commands can be separated by either
any number of spaces or tabs.
.PP
You should also be aware of the programs stnet and sttics that
draw a standard stereonet or tics on a stereonet for use with onnet.
.PP
Onnet was written by Andy Michael of the Geophysics department,
with the algorithm for small circles cribbed from
Paul Layer.  It was written in such a way as
to make adding features easy.  So if it doesn't do something you
want, please tell me by sending mail to andy@erebus.  However,
remember that onnet is a plotting program.  It plots data or results;
it does not, and should not, perform manipulations on the data.  Thus
suggestions that onnet should compute rotations or contour data are
not likely to be acted upon.  However programs that do these could
very easily plot their output by writing onnet input files.
.SH
An Example
.PP
To get the idea of how onnet works here's an example onnet input file:
.sp
title Example
.br
plane 20 30
.br
pole 20 30.
.br
line 270 55
.sp
Let's assume that these four lines are in a file called "input", to
make a plot we then give the command:
.ti 1.
% onnet input > plot
.br
To view the plot we can then use pen, penpr, ret, ctek, ... as in:
.ti 1.
% ipen plot
.br
to print the plot out on the imagen.  It is shown on the next page.
This plot will be titled Example and show on a stereonet a plane
with dip direction 20 degrees east of north and dip 30 degrees, an
"o" at the pole to this plane, and an "x" marking a lineation trending
270 degrees east of north and plunging 55 degrees.  The one
concession to using a computer to do your plotting is the use of dip
directions instead of strikes.  The reason for this is that strikes
are ambiguous by 180 degrees, and you need to have a letter in the dip
which is hard to interpret.  (e.g. A plane striking 30 degrees E of N and
dipping 60 degrees E becomes dip direction=120 degrees and dip= 60
degrees.)
.PP
Input to onnet follows GeoToolKit standards, it can take multiple
input files and will make ONE plot out of them.  The files are
processed in the following order: standard input, in=, other files.
The following will do the same thing:
.br
onnet < input | ret
.br
onnet in=input | ret
.br
onnet input | ret
.br
In addition the output file can be specified with out=file, and the error
can be specified with error=file. i.e.
.br
onnet in=input out=output error=junk
.br
onnet in=file2 file3 < file1 | ret
.br
will process the files in the order file1, file2, file3 and pipe the
output to the ret plotting filter.
.SH
Onnet Input Files
.PP
This section is the meat of the documentation, it tells you everything
onnet can do, and how to structure an input file.  Input lines in
onnet files are divided into viewing parameters and commands and
comment lines.  In general they can be in any order, except that
the order is important for viewing parameters.  A viewing parameter
will affect anything that comes after it, it will have no affect
on any command that comes before it.  Note that most commands
and viewing parameters have
long and short names, they can be used interchangeably.
.KS
.ce
Viewing Parameters
.LP
radius x
.br
radius changes the radius of the plot to x centimeters.  This is the
most constrained command because it must come before any commands
that actually draw things (plane, pole, rake, line, small, move, draw,
great).  You should give it at the top of the file.  The default is
4 cm.  The short form of the command is r.
.KE
.LP
fatness choice n
.br
fatness changes the thickness of the lines or symbols for the command
choice to n.  I.e. fatness line 3 will change all later lines to be
plotted with fat=3 symbols.  The possible choices are: plane, pole, rake
small, move, draw, title, great, and circle.  circle is not a command
but will affect the thickness of the outline of the stereonet.
fatness circle must be called before any commands that actually draw
things if it is to work.  The short name is f.
.LP
fat n
.br
fat changes the thickness of the lines and symbols used to n, the thinest
possible line is fat 0, and this is the default.  The fat command
can be given at ANY line in the file.  It
affects all elements of the plot and exists largely for backwards
compatibility.  New files should use the fatness command.
.LP
color choice n
.br
color changes the color that the lines or symbols for the command
choice to n.  The interger n is translated to a color by the
graphics package (see the vplot documentation for more info).
(The current color definitions (9/26/86) are
black 0, blue 1, red 2, purple 3, green 4, skyblue 5,
yellow 6, and white 7.)
For example: color line 3 will make all later lines purple.
The possible choices are: plane, pole, rake, small, move, draw,
title, great, and circle.  circle is not a command, but it will
affect the color of the outline of the stereonet.  color circle
must be called before any commands that actually draw things if it
is to work.  The short name is c.
.LP
reflect
.br
causes all information on the upper hemisphere to be
reflected about the center of the sphere and plotted on the lower
hemisphere.  This is the default, if neither reflect or through are
specified reflect will be used.
.LP
through
.br
causes all information on the upper hemisphere to be plotted
as if you were above the sphere and were looking down onto the lower
hemisphere.  The viewing type may be changed at ANY line at the file
after the title, although it is rare you will want to, so it will
probably be given once (if it all) near the top.
.LP
schmidt
.br
causes the Schmidt equal-area projection to be used for all items
after it is called.  It is the default and will be used if neither
schmidt or wulff are called.
.LP
wulff
.br
causes the Wulff equal-angle projection to be used for all items
after it is called.  The projection can be changed at any time,
but it is rare that you will want to, so either schmidt or wulff
should be specified once at the top, if at all.
The only time you might
want to change within a file is if you are trying to demonstrate
the effects of the two projections.
.LP
focal
.br
causes all plunges after the command
to be interpreted as take-off angles which
are 0 at vertical down, 90 at horizontal, and 180 at vertical up.
This affects the line, text, small, move, draw, and great commands.
The default is notfocal.
.LP
notfocal
.br
causes all plunges after the command to be determined as plunges.
This is the default.  notfocal will rarely be called, and usually
only if focal was called earlier in the file.
.LP
size choice x
.br
size changes the size of the symbols for the command
choice to x.  The default size is 3, so to make the poles
plot larger you might give the command "size pole 6".  Possible
choices are pole, line, rake, and title.  (Note the default for title
is 10.).  The short name is sz.
.LP
symbol choice l u
.br
symbol changes the symbols used to plot the command choice.
l is the symbol used on the lower hemisphere, u on the upper
hemisphere.  Possible choices are pole, line, and rake.  Only
the lower hemisphere symbol is used for pole because all poles
are plotted on the lower hemisphere.  Defaults are pole 'o',
line 'x' and 's', and rake '+' and '*'.  The short name is sy.
.KS
.ce
Commands
.LP
plane ddir dip
.br
causes a plane to be drawn on the plot with dip
direction ddir, and dip dip.  The short name is p.
.KE
.LP
pole ddir dip
.br
causes the pole to a plane with dip
direction ddir, and dip dip to be plotted.  Poles are all on the lower
hemisphere and are denoted with an "o".  The short name is po.
The symbols can be changed with
the symbol command, their size can be changed with the size command.
.LP
rake slip_angle
.br
rake causes a character to be plotted denoting the slip vector on a
fault.  Rake must come directly after either plane or pole, because
the slip vector is constrained to be in the plane.  rake can also
follow itself to allow plotting multiple slip vectors on one plane,
or w.r.t. one pole.  Rakes on the upper hemisphere
(thrusts) are plotted by "*", and on the lower hemisphere (normal
faults) "+" is used.  The slip angle is measured within the plane, on
the foot wall, from horizontal such that 0 degrees represents a left
handed strike slip fault.  90 is a pure thrust, 180 a right handed
strike slip, and 270 a pure normal fault.  These represent the 
standard seismology conventions.
The symbols can be changed with
the symbol command, their size can be changed with the size command.
The short name is rk.
.LP
line trend plg
.br
causes a character to be plotted to denote a line
(i.e a lineation or magnetic pole) with direction trend and
plunge plg.  For lines on the lower hemisphere (positive plunges)
an "x" is plotted, on
the upper hemisphere "s" is plotted.
The symbols can be changed with
the symbol command, their size can be changed with the size command.
The short name is l.
.LP
small trend plg dist
.br
causes a small circle to be drawn with it's
center at the point trend, plg with radius given in degrees by dist.
The short name is s.
.LP
great trend1 plunge1 trend2 plunge2
.br
great draws a great circle segment connecting the point trend1 plung1
and trend2 plunge2.  It does not do well if reflect viewing is used
and the great circle segment crosses from the upper hemisphere to the
lower hemisphere.  The short name is g.
.LP
move trend plunge
.br
move moves the pen (without drawing)
to the point with direction trend and plunge plunge.
The short name is m.
.LP
draw trend plunge
.br
draw draws from the last point to trend plunge.  It can only be given
after move or draw.  move and draw are useful to draw shapes onnet
does not know about (yet?).  The short name is d.  The short name is m.
.LP
text trend plunge :string
.br
text posts the string of text at the point trend plunge.  The first
character of the string will be positioned so that if it is a capital
letter it will be centered on the given point.  The string starts
immediately after the colon and can include spaces (and even start
with a colon). The short name is t.
.LP
title rest of line
.br
Sets the title of the plot to be whatever is the rest of the line.
The title is plotted last so it can be specified anywhere within
the file, but only once.  For backwards compatibility if onnet
does not understand the first line of the file it becomes the title.
.ce
Comment lines
.LP
# Rest of line.
.br
Any line beginning with a '#' is a comment line.

Backwards compatibility
.PP
I have attempted to make this version of onnet completely backwards
compatible with the older version.  However older users might be
advised to use the new features: comment lines, better fat control,
great circle segments, and Wulff projections.  In addition the title
command makes the file format somewhat freer.  The addition of
abbreviated command names should also make files easier to deal with
(although harder to read).
.SH
Features already on the list to be added:
.PP
.in 1i
Area filled beach ball focal mechanisms.
.br
Orthogonal plane pairs from ddir, dip, and rake.
.br
Variable linetypes for plane, great, and small.
