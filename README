The makefiles in this directory are set up to run with a library
called loc that is local to Stanford Earth Sciences.  The directory
needed to make this directory is in this directory and is called
LOCAL.  It also has a makefile in it to make the library and may
need some modification to run on your machine.  Other than that you
have to replace the graphics calls in onnet.c and center.c
with your own graphics library.  The calls are:
		fat(title.fat);  which sets the fatness of lines or symbols
	utext(titlex,titley,symsz,0,cap); which places text (also in center.c)
	vpfilep(out_file); sets the file pointer for graphics output
	orig(z,z); sets the origin in plot coordinates
	scale(1.,1.); sets the scales
	uorig(0.,0.); sets the user origin
	uclip(-z,-z,z,z+1.+(z/10.)); sets the limits to clip on
			umove (x,y); move in user coordinates 
			udraw (x,y); draw in user coordinates
			where (&xc,&yc); where is pen in screen coordinates
			text(xc-cwd2,yc-chd2,symbsz,0,string); draw text

text and utext are of the form
(x_location,ylocation,size of symbol,0,string to put on plot)
0 means text is in normal orientation (not upside down or something).
